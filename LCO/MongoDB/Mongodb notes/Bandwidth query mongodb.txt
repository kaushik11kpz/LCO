-> Reduce the cost of bandwidth while taking to database on Internet
- Information from database comes in form of CURSOR which is a metadata(information about the information)
- Until you actually query for information from database, CURSOR comes(which contains all the information)
- find() in cmd gives a CURSOR object and we just then extract the information from it.

--> This command works at the database level. Thus it COST EFFECTIVE in operation (consumes less bandwidth)
17. db.studentData.find( {}, {email:1, name:1, _id:0} )  
--> This cmd gives array of email
-> This operations occurs at database thus, dumping of data on website is prevented leading to cost effective operations
18  db.studentData.find( {}, {email:1, name:1, _id:0} ).toArray()  

--> To find a key with multiple object
19.  db.studentData.find({name:"Hitesh"}, {"profilepic.large": 500}).pretty()
--> To update a key with multiple object
20. db.studentData.updateOne({name: "Hitesh"}, {$set: { "profilepic.large": 500}})
--> To update database with key-value(array) pair
21. db.studentData.updateOne( {name: "Hitesh"}, {$set : { lastLogin : ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"]}})
--> To get array as output in key-array pair
22. db.studentData.findOne({name:"Hitesh"}).lastLogin
