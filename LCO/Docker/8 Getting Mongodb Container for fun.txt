-Container is like a secret cage
-One cannot directly see what is happening inside it, or cannot extract anything from docker container
-(-it) is a command used to look and use the features of the closed container

-Here, we demonstrate how can we access inside container for using a mongodb, which is not installed in our system
-we use (docker run mongo) to run the mongodb inside container
-Now, we cannot use mongodb from outside of container
-To access mongodb, we need command (docker exec -it ID bash) - to access the bash inside of container
-Now, since the root(image) terminal is open, we can access mongodb by using mongo command
-CTRL + D - is used to exit from inside of image terminal

Commands
1. docker exec -it ID bash (in place of bash - sh/powershell etc can be used)
2. docker stop ID (used to stop an image of ID)
3. docker start ID (to run/start an image of ID)
4. CTRL + D(to exit from image terminal)
